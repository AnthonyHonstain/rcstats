The scripts contained here are primarily for uploading results or 
modifying race data in the DB.

Overview
	ReadLaps.py - the first script created to push race results 
		into the system. 
		DO NOT USE, it does not correctly execute 
		SQL queries. This is largely obsolete because of the 
		new app that handles pushing results to the DB.
		
		Some useful references for fixing it.

	CollapseNames.py - a quick script for identifying and collapsing 
		alias names. Race directors often misspell a racers name, this is a 
		quick way to identify and fix those problems.	

	singlerace.py and rcscoringprotxtparser* are the parsers used to read 
		the scoring txt file.
