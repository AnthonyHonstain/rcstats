This is a Django project for code that powers the www.rc-stats.com web site.

The majority of the html, css, and JS are stored in a separate private repo
because I do not have the rights to distribute them. 

Overview of the apps in this project.
	rcdata - The primary app, this defines the models for all the race data.
		The other apps highly coupled with rcdata.
		
	myresults - App responsible to displaying data specific to individual
		users. A case could be made for pushing this functionality 
		into rcdata, but because of the future plans for more user 
		specific functionality I have placed it in a separate app.
		
	trackdata - This app is similar to myresults, but with information 
		specific to individual race tracks.

	displayresults - This app holds general views that are used by both 
		myresults and trackdata.

	ranking - The application for tracking the ranking of racers. Right 
		now it is just a place holder.

	uploadresults - Auth loggin and two separate uploader scenarios.
		- An easyuploader which lets you upload multiple races at once.
			- This is the most up to date uploader, and I have taken an pass
			  as performance since it was getting slow.
		- The origional uploader I created which uploads a single race at atime
		  but lets you change the track for each race.

Better documentation is pending, I have the majority of information in a onenote
and I am in the process of moving it to a series of blog posts.

NOTE - This is an ongoing project and is a tool for my own learning and growth in
	Django, JS, JQuery, etc.
