<h3>Got Questions? We've Got Answers!</h3>
<p>This is our FAQ's page where you can learn about the site and how to get involved.</p>

        <h3>What is rc-stats?</h3>
        <p>If you have raced RC (remote control) vehicles, then you know that the process of reviewing your race results is still a process out of the 90's. Have you ever wanted to know what your results were after you left the track, or had the race director's printer break? That is where rc-stats comes in, to empower you the racer by delivering personalized race results in one organized and easy to use site.</p>
		<p>Racers are busy people and we need modern tools to help us track race results and get the most enjoyment from our race days. Real time ranking and scoring are an expected feature in any modern video game, we should have the same expectations for racing RC.</p>

        <h3>What information does rc-stats have?</h3>
        <p>At the core we store races results, from that we organize them in several different ways. For each racer in the system, a special page is generated which organizes their particular results together along with compiling general statistics. For each track, we create and individualized page to organize their races results along with track stats (like total wins, or current racer rankings).</p>

        <h3>Video walkthrough of the site.</h3>
        <p>Please watch the video below for a simple walk through of the main features.</p>

        <h3>How can I help?</h3>
        <p>We are looking for responsible members of the community to upload race results. The system is not dependent on the track or there computer, if you have access to the results (txt format, not pdf) generated by RCScoringPro then you can upload them to rc-stats at your leisure using our automated web interface.
This is helpful because many tracks do not have access to internet at the race facility, so when racing is over you can retrieve the result files and upload them at a later point from any computer with an internet connection. It also means the race director does not need to be responsible for the upload (one less thing for the busiest person at the track).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why should my track be on RC-Stats?</h3>		
        <p>RC-stats provides additional visibility to your track, new racers to the sport or region are able to see the popular classes. This is free advertising for the track along with increasing the likelihood that new visitors will have a good time (did they have the right class (buggy, stock touring, novice, etc)). This is a free service with tremendous value to existing racers, they are able to review all their results in a single location (no need to track them in a spread sheet) and they get track wide ranking and leaderboards. Features and functionality that are available no where else.</p>
        
        <h3>How can my track get involved?</h3>
        <p>We need volunteers to help collect and upload race data. The service is provided free to tracks and their racers.</p>                      
        <p>Any track or event using the RCScoringPro can have its own section of rc-stats along with ranking and personalized results for all of it's racers.</p>
